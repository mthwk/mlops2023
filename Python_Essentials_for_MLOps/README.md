# Python Essentials for MLOps
This repository contains several projects related to 'Python Essential Skills for Machine Learning Operations' that were completed based on Dataquest courses. Some of the following practices were applied:

- Code Refactoring: The code has been organized and restructured to improve clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Clean Code Principles: Clean code principles have been followed to make the code more readable and understandable.
- Linting: Automatic code checks have been performed to identify potential issues, style violations, and errors.
- Exception Handling: The code has been developed with proper exception handling, ensuring the system gracefully handles errors and exceptional situations.
- Logging: Logging has been implemented to track the system's operation, facilitating debugging and issue identification.

## Project Description
There are three projects in this repository:

- [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/gabrielaact/mlops/tree/main/Python%20Essentials%20for%20MLOps/Project%2001): The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide movie recommendations based on user input. Users can enter the name of a movie, and the system generates recommendations using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to find similar movie titles. Additionally, users can input a movie ID to discover movies that are similar based on user ratings. The system utilizes Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity for recommendation calculations. To run the system, ensure you have Python 3.x, Pandas and Scikit-learn installed. The movie data is expected to be in CSV files, namely 'data/movies.csv' and 'data/ratings.csv'.
